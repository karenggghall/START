OTC [otc deals crypto](https://coinspaid.com/otc-desk/) are large, private transactions happening directly between buyers and sellers, avoiding exchanges. Think millions (or billions!) in crypto traded discreetly, often by institutions or crypto whales. OTC platforms cater to these big players with custom transactions and privacy.  Keep in mind higher fees, minimum order sizes, and counterparty risk when considering OTC.
